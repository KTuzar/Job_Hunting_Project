# Job Hunting Project

Following my job hunting process, analyzing the job ads and current status of my job applications. 
<br>It is rough out there!
<br>I am applying for positions in 4 main fields:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - data (looking for junior positions, eager to work with SQL and Python, have completed 72 hours worth of courses and actively learning and practicing),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - localization (looking for localization PM positions, have 3 years of experience in the localization industry and a degree in Chinese Studies),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - gaming (mainly applying for localization or PM positions within the gaming industry),
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - PM (2+ years of experience as a project manager).
<br>
<br>Notes:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - data is pulled from 'Applications_GitHub.xlsx'
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - data in the .xlsx which I am sharing on GitHub is incomplete for privacy purposes â€“ company names, direct links for job ads and some other data I'm collecting have been removed
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - libraries used: pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - colors for plots: https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/gallery/color/named_colors.html
